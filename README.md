Fauxmo for Particle
-------------------

This is a port of the fine work done by [makermusings][] on the [fauxmo][] over to C++ and the Particle ecosystem. Fair warning, I am not a systems developer by day. My stock and trade consists of Javascript, Ruby, and (when pressed) some Java.

Pull requests are welcome and appreciated.
